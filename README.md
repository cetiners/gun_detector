## THREAT TYPE DETECTOR -BINARY IMAGE CLASSIFICATION WITH CNN's


#### Scope & Data Source

In this project, the main objective is to create a CNN model using Keras API that can successfully classify Knife vs Pistol images to determine the threat type of a crime taking place.

To accomodate the need for training images of guns, knives and similar hand-held objects were gathered from the database published by the Andalusian Research Institute in Data Science and Computational Intelligence, “Weapons detection for security and video surveillance”.

This dataset was used as it consists of handheld and standalone shots of guns, knives, long barrels and similar objects as in cards, keys and even contextually unrelated objects as leopards and aeroplanes. that can be used with all possible project scopes.
