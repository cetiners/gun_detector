## Binary Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks

Please refer to the master_notebook for the proposed model. 

#### Scope & Data Source

This project is created for the Deep Learning course in NOVA Information Management School. The main objective is to create a CNN model using Keras API that can successfully classify Knife vs Pistol images.

To accomodate the need for training images of guns, knives and similar hand-held objects were gathered from the database published by the Andalusian Research Institute in Data Science and Computational Intelligence, “Weapons detection for security and video surveillance”.

This dataset was used as it consists of handheld and standalone shots of guns, knives, long barrels and similar objects as in cards, keys and even contextually unrelated objects as leopards and aeroplanes. that can be used with all possible project scopes.
